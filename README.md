# Enhancing Outcome Prediction in Football: An Advanced Feature Engineering Approach

## Overview
This project presents a methodology for predicting match outcomes in football by combining advanced feature engineering techniques with the XGBoost machine learning algorithm using the European Soccer Database (ESD), a comprehensive dataset from 11 European leagues over 8 seasons, to develop innovative features and build predictive models with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Goal Difference Trend**: Calculates the moving average of goal differences for home and away teams.
- **Discipline Trend**: Aggregates fouls, yellow cards, and red cards to create a discipline score.
- **Strength of the Opposition**: Evaluates the strength of opponents faced by each team.
- **Home Team Advantage**: Quantifies the advantage of playing at home.
- **Recent Form**: Assesses the recent performance of teams based on historical data.
- **Relational Strength**: Measures the recent record of teams against their opponents.
